# college_food_choices_casestudy
A College Food Choices Case Study This project was developed as part of a data visualization case study using Tableau. The objective was to analyze and visually present insights into college studentsâ€™ dietary behaviors, food perceptions, and health impacts. All dashboards and the final data story were personally designed and created based on a cleaned survey dataset.

Project Objectives Transform raw dietary survey data into actionable, interactive visualizations. Identify patterns in eating habits, health perceptions, and physical activity. Provide decision-makers with insights to support healthy lifestyle initiatives on campus. Lay the foundation for predictive strategies aimed at long-term student wellness.
